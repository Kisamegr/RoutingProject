# Virtual CPU-Process Emulator

## Semester project for the *Operating Systems* academic course.

The goal of the project was to create a **Java** application in order to emulate the Shortest Job First (SJF) cpu process scheduling, with preemptive or non-preemtive modes, process generation customization, and a clear-informative GUI + catchy background music.
